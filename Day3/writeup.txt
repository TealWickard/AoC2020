Code isn't pretty, but I was going for speed!
I parsed the file into a 2d array.
I then set coordinates to toboggan down, and looped by checking for when it was out of bounds and subtracting the limit.
For part 2, I copied the code 4 times and stored the answers in an array for future multiplication.
